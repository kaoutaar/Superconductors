# Superconductors

the goal of this notebook is modeling critical temperature of a superconductor based on its chemical properties using two regression models, Decision tree and Random forest.

The first part will tackle the theory behind the algorithms and gives a short presentation of the relative parameters and metrics.
The second part will be reserved to the dataset preprocessing, after introducing the necessary techniques to that purpose.
And in the last part, an evaluation of the models' performance will be presented as well as a comparative analysis to determine wich one gets to decode the pattern behind data.
