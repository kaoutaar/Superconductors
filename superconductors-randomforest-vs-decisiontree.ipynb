This process continues until each node or partition reaches a user-prespecified minimum node size and becomes a terminal node. (If the quantity $\\sum\\limits_{x_i \\in node} (y_i-c_{node})^2$ in a node is zero, then that node is considered a terminal node even if it has not reached the minimum size.)  \n       \n\nA very large tree might overfit the data, while a small tree might not capture the important structure. this tradeoff is governed by the tree size, and to find the best tree size, we use the cost complexity pruning algorithm:\n> * start by growing a large tree $T_0$ and stop spplitting process only when minimum node size is reached.  \n* for a given $\\alpha$ find $T(\\alpha) \\subseteq T_0$ that minimize   \n  \n  \n <center> $ C_{\\alpha}(T) = C(T) + \\alpha|\\tilde T|$ </center>    \n   \n   \n>with $T$ define any subtree $\\subset T_0$, and $|\\tilde T|$  denote the number of terminal nodes in $T$,  and  $ C(T) =\\sum\\limits_{t \\in \\tilde T} N_t Q_t$ , $t$ indexes terminal nodes\n  \n  <center> $ Q_t= \\frac 1{N_t} \\sum\\limits_{x_i \\in R_t}(y_i-\\hat c_t)^2 $ </center>    \n   <center> $ N_t= cardinal\\{x_i \\in R_t\\} $ </center>  \n     \n     \n   <center> $ \\hat c_t= \\frac 1{N_t} \\sum\\limits_{x_i \\in R_t}y_i $ </center>\n     \n> * try the above for different values of $\\alpha$ and pick $\\hat \\alpha$ that minimizes the cross-validated error. It's clear that for $\\alpha = 0$ the solution is the full tree $T_0$ and with increasing $\\alpha$ the tree becomes smaller and smaller implying less complexity.\n\nOnce the final tree $T(\\hat \\alpha)$ is built, for every new observation that falls into a terminal node, the predicted response will be the mean value of responses in that node.\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Random forest regression algorithm\n\nRandom forest is a kind of regression trees bagging, the idea behind is to construct multiple trees at training time and averaging the results to end up with a single prediction model highly accurate.  \nThe conception of the algorithm is simple but requires a short explanation of each step:  \n* For $b=1, ...,B$ :  \n\n * Sample from $X_n, Y_n$, with replacement, n-sized sample  $X_b, Y_b$ .  \n \n * for each bootsrapped training set $X_b, Y_b$, a random selection of $m$ predictors is chosen as split candidates from the full set of $p$ predictors, typically we choose $m= \\sqrt p$.  \n \n * Train a regression tree $\\hat T_b$ on $X_b, Y_b$.   \n   \n* for each new sample $x^* $, the predicted response is $ \\hat y^* = \\frac 1{B} \\sum\\limits_{b=1}^{B} \\hat y^b$  \n  \n  \n<br>\n<br>\n\n## Performance metrics\n  \nmany performance metrics exist to evaluate the quality of fit of a regression model, The most commonly used are:\n\n* MSE (Mean Squared Error), is defined as the average squared distance between the actual score and the predicted score, a good regression model is characterized by a small MSE and vice-versa\n\n<center> $MSE= \\frac { \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\hat y_i)^2 }n $ </center>\n<br>\n* MAE (Mean Absolute Error), is the average of absolute differences between our target and predicted values,\n\n<center> $MAE= \\frac { \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n |y_i-\\hat y_i| }n $ </center>\n\n<br>\n\nthe main difference between MSE and MAE is that this latter is less sensitive to outliers, how ?? ===>\nImagine a target with a spread of values in $[3,12] $ and some outliers ranging from $70$ to $100$, the squared error between 100 and 3 is huge $(100-3)^2=9409$ compared to the absolute error  $|100-3|=97$, which gives impression that the MSE is huge as well. The algorithm by trying to minimize this MSE it will gives more weights to outliers, this scenario will certainly lead to overfitted and biased model. \n\nSo MAE loss is more preferable if we detect the existence of a outliers.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2. Data preprocessing\n\none of the most important steps in data preprocessing is feature selection which aims at reducing the dimensionality of the problem, and eliminate redundant or irrelevant (noisy) variables. Benefits are twofold: it decreases complexity of the predictive model, and allows more accurate prediction since high-dimensionality makes predictive models more prone to overfitting, and estimates of parameters more variant.   \n\nTwo are the main approaches to feature selection:\n* Filter methods: They attempt to assess the merits of features from the data, ignoring the effects of the selected feature subset on the performance of the learning algorithm. Examples are methods that select variables by ranking them through compression techniques (like PCA), or by computing correlation or a more advanced similarity measure such as minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) with the output.   \n* Wrapper methods: these methods assess subsets of variables according to their usefulness to a given predictor. The method conducts a search for a good subset using the learning algorithm itself as part of the evaluation function. The problem boils down to a problem of stochastic state space search. Example are the stepwise methods proposed in linear regression analysis.\n\n## Correlation Analysis Between Predictors\n\nafter loading the training dataset we will try to investigate correlation between features, and if any features selection technique might be applied\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import requests, io, zipfile\n\nr = requests.get(\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00464/superconduct.zip\")\nz = zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(r.content))\ndata = pd.read_csv(z.open('train.csv'))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-05T12:52:55.865081Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-05T12:52:55.865533Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-05T12:52:58.582318Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-05T12:52:55.865484Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-05T12:52:58.581232Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-05T12:52:58.58372Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-05T12:52:58.584047Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-05T12:52:58.623884Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-05T12:52:58.584012Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-05T12:52:58.622253Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.info()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-05T12:52:58.626279Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-05T12:52:58.626713Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-05T12:52:58.659654Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-05T12:52:58.626671Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-05T12:52:58.658087Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Except for number_of_elements and critical temperature; all of the variables are derived using highly correlated mathematical functions; mean, weighted mean, geometric mean, weighted geometric mean, standard deviation, weighted standard deviation, entropy, weighted entropy, range and weighted range calculations.
